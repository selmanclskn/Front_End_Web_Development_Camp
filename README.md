<h1> My Front-End Web Development Journey </h1>

<p>This is my first repo on Github. The purpose of creating this repo is to record my <b>Front-End Web Development </b>adventure step by step. As I continue to learn, I will always keep this place updated. I hope it will be a repo that can guide people who want to improve themselves in the Front-End field...</p>
<p>The courses of Jonas Schmedtmann, whose trainings are available on the Udemy platform, are the main source for this repo I created. You can access the instructor's courses from the link <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/" >here.</a> </p>
